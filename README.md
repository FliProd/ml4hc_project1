# Project 1 - Time Series

## Setting up environment

### Requirements

### Setup

#### Environment
To create the environment run:

    conda env create -f environment.yml --prefix venv

To activate the environment run: 

    conda activate venv -n ml4hc_p1

To deactivate the environment run:

    conda deactivate

To update the environment run:

    conda env update --prefix ./venv --file environment.yml  --prune

#### Data

Download the data.zip file from moodle and store the .csv files in the data/raw/ directory.

## Running models

For most models just set the appropriate value for config['model'] in config/config.py. The hyperparameters can be set in the models/hyperparameters.py file. Then to actually train/evaluate the model execute:
    
    python main.py

This will then call the appropriate training function which either loads wheights from a stored model with the same hyperparameters or trains it from scratch. After loading/training the model main.py also evaluates it according to the dataset.


For ensemble and our cnn just run:
    python train_cnn.py
    python ensemble.py
